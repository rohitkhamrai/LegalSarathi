# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Legal Sarathi 2.0

## 1. Project Overview
**Name:** Legal Sarathi 2.0
**Tagline:** "Apna Kanoon, Apni Bhasha" (Your Law, Your Language)
**Vision:** To democratize legal intelligence across India by providing a high-speed, multilingual, AI-powered platform that decodes complex legal statutes, drafts documents, and connects citizens with verified local advocates.

## 2. Problem Statement
The Indian legal system is notoriously complex, slow, and inaccessible to the common citizen due to language barriers, heavy legalese, and high consultation costs. Citizens struggle to understand basic rights, file simple complaints (like RTIs or consumer disputes), or find reliable local lawyers. 

## 3. Target Audience
- **General Citizens:** Individuals seeking to understand their rights in traffic violations, consumer fraud, or tenant disputes.
- **Vulnerable Groups:** Women seeking immediate, discreet information on domestic violence or workplace harassment (POSH).
- **Small Business Owners/Startups:** Founders needing quick NDAs, lease agreements, or IP protection guidance.
- **Rural/Non-English Speakers:** Users who require legal guidance in their native vernacular languages (Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, etc.).

## 4. Core Objectives & Scope
1. **Multilingual Accessibility:** Provide highly accurate legal advice in 8+ Indian languages.
2. **Actionable Outputs:** Generate draftable documents instead of just giving generic advice.
3. **Verified Connections:** Route users to real, verified lawyers in their specific city and practice area.
4. **Performance:** Ensure the system runs efficiently on local hardware (16GB RAM constraint) using optimized vector search and asynchronous LLM pipelines.

- **Interactions:** Subtle glassmorphism (`glass-card`), tactile button feedback (`tap`), and progressive reveals.

### 6.3. Scalability & Deployment
- Must support fallback execution modes: Neon `pgvector` for scalable cloud deployment, and local `FAISS` indices for offline/edge computing limitations.

## 7. Future Roadmap
