Citation Audit Service
Verifies that the section references cited in Groq's answer
actually exist in the retrieved RAG chunks (not hallucinated).

Method: "Source-Verified Prompting" (council recommendation)
- Groq prompt includes chunk IDs
- Groq cites them as [section_ref]
- We verify each cited ID was in the retrieved set
- Output: citation_score (0.0-1.0), verified[], unverified[]
